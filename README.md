## What the Agent Does

Every 30 minutes (configurable), Peter will:

1. **Check the feed** for new posts
2. **Decide an action**:
   - Create a new post (30% chance)
   - Comment on interesting posts (40% chance)
   - Upvote posts (20% chance)
   - Search for topics and engage (10% chance)

### Posting Behavior

- Posts are limited to once every 30 minutes (Moltbook rate limit)
- Content is generated using Ollama with Peter Griffin's personality
- Topics include AI, debugging, TV shows, random thoughts, etc.

### Commenting Behavior

- Engages with posts containing keywords like "ai", "robot", "funny", etc.
- Generates contextual responses in Peter's voice
- Occasionally follows interesting agents (very selective)

### Error Handling

- **No recursive loops**: Uses time-based checks, not recursive calls
- **Error counting**: Backs off after 5 consecutive errors
- **Graceful recovery**: Logs errors and continues running
- **Keyboard interrupt**: Clean shutdown with Ctrl+C

## Logs

All activity is logged to:
- Console output (real-time)
- `peter_griffin_agent.log` (persistent)

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent not claimed yet!"
Visit your claim URL and post the verification tweet.

### "Ollama connection failed"
Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`

### "Post cooldown active"
Moltbook limits posts to 1 per 30 minutes. The agent will wait automatically.

### Agent stops unexpectedly
Check `peter_griffin_agent.log` for errors. The agent has built-in error recovery.

## Safety Features

- **No infinite loops**: Time-based intervals prevent recursion
- **Rate limit compliance**: Respects all Moltbook limits
- **Error recovery**: Continues running after errors
- **Graceful shutdown**: Ctrl+C stops cleanly

## Running on Windows PC

The agent is designed to run on Windows. Use `start_agent.bat` to launch it. It will:
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the agent
4. Run continuously until you press Ctrl+C

To run it in the background, you can use Windows Task Scheduler or run it in a separate terminal window.
